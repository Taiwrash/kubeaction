## Using this made easy

**Prerequisites:**
- Make sure you have Go installed on your local machine.
- Install `kubectl` and configure it to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
1. Clone the repository containing your Go application and the deployment files.

**Step 2: Configure Kubernetes Manifests**
1. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
2. Open the `kubernetes` directory.
3. Modify the Kubernetes manifests (`test.yaml`, `stage.yaml`, `production.yaml`) according to your application's requirements. Update the image name, ports, environment variables, and other necessary configurations.
4. Save the changes to the Kubernetes manifest files.

**Step 3: Configure Deployment Scripts**
1. Open the repository's root directory.
2. Create the deployment scripts for each environment by following the examples provided earlier (`deploy_dev_test.sh`, `deploy_dev_stage.sh`, `deploy_staging_test.sh`, `deploy_staging_prod.sh`, `deploy_prod.sh`).
3. Customize the deployment scripts to match your deployment requirements. Update the paths to the Kubernetes manifest files in each script.

**Step 4: Adjust the Go Deployment Logic**
1. Open the `main.go` file in your Go application's root directory.
2. Update the deployment logic in the `deployToDevelopment`, `deployToStaging`, and `deployToProduction` functions to match your application's specific deployment steps for each environment and target.
3. Save the changes to the `main.go` file.

**Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow**
1. Create a new file named `.github/workflows/main.yml` in the root directory of your repository.
2. Copy the content of the provided GitHub Actions workflow into `ci_cd.yml`.
3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

**Step 6: Trigger the CI/CD Workflow**
1. Push your changes to the repository's `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI/CD workflow defined in the `ci_cd.yml` file.
3. The workflow will build and test your Go application and then deploy it to the specified environments: test, stage, and production.

**Step 7: Verify the Deployments**
1. Access your Kubernetes cluster and verify that the application has been deployed to the test, stage, and production environments.
2. Ensure that the deployments and pods are running successfully.

That's it! You've successfully set up the solution to deploy your Go application to multiple environments in a Kubernetes cluster using GitHub Actions and the provided deployment scripts.

You can further customize the deployment scripts, Kubernetes manifests, and Go deployment logic to match your specific application requirements and deployment process.

Remember to keep your deployment scripts and Kubernetes manifests up to date as your application evolves or new versions are released.
